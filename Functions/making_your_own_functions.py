#### EXAMPLE OF A VERY BASIC FUNCTION ####

# This defines a function called say_hi.
# It does not take any inputs (no parameters).
def say_hi():
    # This line runs when the function is called.
    print("Hi, I'm a computer.")

# This calls the function so the code inside it will run.
say_hi()



#### EXAMPLE OF A FUNCTION THAT TAKES 1 ARGUMENT ####
# # This defines a function that expects 1 argument: name.
# def say_hi(name):
#     print(f"Hi, {name}")
#
# name = "Mr Freer"
# say_hi(name)



#### EXAMPLE OF A FUNCTION THAT TAKES 2 ARGUMENTS ####

# # This defines a function that expects 2 parameters: name and favourite_food.
# def say_hi(name, favourite_food):
#     # Stores the parameters in local variables (again, showing the process)
#     name = name
#     food = favourite_food
#
#     # Prints a message using both pieces of data.
#     print(f"Hi, {name}. I like {food} also.")
#
# # Creating variables to hold the data to pass to the function.
# name = "Mr Freer"
# favourite_food = "pizza"
#
# # Calling the function with two arguments.
# say_hi(name, favourite_food)




#### EXAMPLE OF A FUNCTION THAT TAKES 2 ARGUMENTS AND USES RANDOM NUMBERS ####

# import random
#
# def calculate_damage(player_strength, player_speed):
#     strength = player_strength
#     speed = player_speed
#     damage = (strength * 2) * (speed / 2) * random.randint(0,3)
#     print(f"You did {damage} points of damage!")
#
# player_strength = 5
# player_speed = 2
# calculate_damage(player_strength, player_speed)
