#write a for loop that checks each element of the list
#to see if it's the target number.
#if it finds the number, tell the user that you found it.
#if possible, tell the user what index location it was found at.

#you'll need:
# a variable containing your target number
# a variable containing your list of numbers
# a for loop to iterate through every element on the list
# an if statement to compare the current element to your target
# a print statement telling the user if you found the target
# and a print statement telling the user what index the target was found at.
